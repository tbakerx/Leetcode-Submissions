# 193. Valid Phone Numbers

Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.


### Solution [Accepted]

Just a simple regular expression solution to check that inputs follow the specific formats
