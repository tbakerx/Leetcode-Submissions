# 7. Reverse Integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

### Solution [Accepted]

Simply reverses the digits of the integer and checks for a 32-bit overflow.
