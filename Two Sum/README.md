# 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


### Solution 1 - Brute Force [Accepted]

Brute force. Take first value and search the rest of array to check if anything satisfies. If not, move on to the next value.

Time complexity: O(n^2)

Space complexity: O(1)
